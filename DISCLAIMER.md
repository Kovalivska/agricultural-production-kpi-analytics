## About This Repository

This repository contains a research prototype developed during a Data Science internship at Data Coffee GmbH (June–September 2025).

## Confidentiality & Data Protection

All client-specific information has been removed or anonymized.

### Removed or generalized
- Client names → "Sample_Client"
- Product names → "Material_A", "Product_Type_1"
- Facility locations → "Facility_A", "Location_Region_A"
- Real production data → Synthetic examples only
- Specific equipment models → Generic types
- Client business logic → Generic algorithms
- Proprietary KPI formulas → Standard calculations
- Financial details → Anonymized examples

### What remains (for demonstration)
- Technical methodology and approach
- System architecture and design
- KPI framework (40+ metrics)
- Database optimization concepts
- Dashboard and visualization concepts
- Development skills demonstration

## Performance Metrics: Context

Figures represent potential outcomes based on industry benchmarks, academic literature, expert estimations, and similar implementations. They are not guaranteed results and vary by facility conditions, baseline, implementation quality, and adoption.

- 15–25% reduction in production losses: potential via early detection
- 20–30% improvement in equipment efficiency: potential via utilization optimization
- 10–15% reduction in QC costs: potential via automation
- 80% automation: monitoring tasks only, not production processes
- 95%+ accuracy: KPI calculation accuracy on test datasets
- Sub-second processing: computational speed, not decision time

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates the technical approach, KPI framework, dashboards, database design, and development skills. It does not contain real client data, proprietary business logic, client-specific configurations, or confidential operational details.

## Production Use Requirements

Customization, integration, validation with real data, expert input, testing, training, and ongoing optimization are required for deployment.
