# Production KPI System Methodology

## Overview

This document describes the technical methodology for a comprehensive KPI monitoring system designed for manual and semi-automated production processes.

## System Architecture

Data Sources → Data Pipeline → KPI Calculator → Database → Dashboard → Alerts

### Components

1. Data Collection Layer
   - Sensor integration
   - Manual data entry
   - Time series storage

2. Processing Layer
   - Data validation and cleaning
   - KPI calculations (40+ metrics)
   - Aggregation and rollups

3. Storage Layer
   - Optimized database schema (36 tables)
   - Historical data retention
   - Query performance optimization

4. Presentation Layer
   - Real-time dashboards
   - Alert notifications
   - Report generation

## KPI Framework (40+ Metrics)

- Production efficiency (throughput, cycle time, utilization)
- Quality control (defect rates, FPY, quality scores)
- Equipment performance (OEE, availability, performance, quality)
- Resource management (waste %, energy, labor, cost per unit)

## Algorithm Approach

Hybrid calculation system combining rule-based formulas, statistical analysis (trend/anomaly), and real-time processing with sub-second latency for critical alerts.

Accuracy 95%+ refers to formula correctness on test datasets.

## Database Optimization

Indexed timestamps, partitioning, materialized views, selective denormalization, and archiving for performance. Sub-second dashboard queries for common views.

## Real-Time Dashboard

Live updates, interactive visuals, drill-downs, customizable views, and alert notifications using Chart.js and Bootstrap.

## Alert System

Critical/Warning/Info levels with threshold-based triggers and trend analysis.

## Performance Characteristics

- Real-time: < 1s critical processing
- Batch: < 5 min hourly aggregations
- Reports: < 30s daily summaries

## Implementation Considerations

Prerequisites: data collection infra, network, DB and web server. Integrations: sensors, ERP, QMS, CMMS. Customization: industry KPIs, rules, thresholds, dashboard layout.

## Validation Methodology

Formula validation, benchmarking, UAT, and pilot recommended. Success: 95%+ calc accuracy, <2s queries, 99%+ uptime, positive user feedback.

## Best Practices

Start with pilot line, validate data quality, train users, iterate on feedback, monitor performance, backup, and maintain documentation.

Note: Generic methodology; specific deployments require customization and expert input.
